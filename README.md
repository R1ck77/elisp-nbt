## Emacs LISP NBT library

**WORK IN PROGRESS** The implementation is not complete!

Basic Emacs Lisp library to read/write Minecraft **Named Binary Tag** format files.

The C module could be replaced in priciple with an all LISP implementation of IEEE-754 but I don't see any fun in doing that :)

Requirements:

- emacs with dynamic module loading compiled in
- Linux (heavy reference to .so extensions)
- make and gcc for the library compilation

I'm using https://wiki.vg/NBT for reference.
