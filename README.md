## Emacs LISP NBT library

Basic Emacs Lisp library to read/write Minecraft **Named Binary Tag** format files.

This library  uses a C module for long/double/float parsing which could, in principle, be replaced with a pure Emacs LISP IEEE-754 implementation, but it's a lot work and not a funny thing to do, so you are stuck with the C module :)

It can currentl read the examples found here

    https://wiki.vg/NBT
    
as well as one of my Minecraft level.dat files, so it's bug free of course! :)

**NBT writing/updating is not yet supported**

## Requirements

You will need:

- Emacs with dynamic module loading compiled in (you will probably need to compile your own Emacs from source)
- GNU make, GCC and linux if you want to compile the library automatically

## Installation

Run `make` to compile the library and run the automatic tests.

To read a NBT file open `nbt.el` and, assuming you are in the library folder:

    (setq load-path (cons "." load-path))
    (require 'nbt)
    (nbt/read-file "path to the nbt file")

should return a hierarchy of simple EIEIO objects with `name` and `value` fields.

Note that, due to the limitations of Emacs primitives, precision may be lost on float values, and long tags are read as string representations.
